# Parallel Processing with OpenMP

Simple code to showcase use of OpenMP to run code on multiple threads.

**Instructions**

hello_opm.c

```
g++ hello_opm.c -o hello_opm -fopenmp
./hello_opm <number_of_threads>
```

Algorithms implemented are:
1. Quick Sort
2. Odd-Even Transposition Sort
3. Merge Sort (with Arrays or Double Linked Lists)
