### String Search

Search based on parts of word. Special characters **"*"** and **"?"** are used to represent any length string and a single character respectively.

So the program finds words that match the given word with the special characters.

For example: 
1. "main*" would find "mainly"
3. "geo*y" would find "geography"
4. "w?rk" would find "work"
5. "Gith?b" would find "GitHub"
6. "g?ogr*y" would find "geography"
